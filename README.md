# Mobile Flashcards
A mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
Its goal is to help users memorize things. It will allow the user to create a deck to which they can add a new card where each card represents a question. The user can view the answer and then mark in the system whether or not they got the question correct. A total score is taken and on reaching the end of the deck, the user can view the percentage of correct answers they got for their current deck.
This application was built using React native and Redux.

if it showed an error of "App js" has no default export. just move to another tap and get back to this tap or minimize and maximize the browser the error will disappear it is not a techincal error it is a bug through the website.

I captured live videos for how the app works:

## Installation
First, you have to install Node.js on your computer. Then, write these commands in the project's directory in Terminal.
I prefer using the snack website provided before because it is where i developed the entire app, then i exported it. according to expo snack website if you run these 2 commands it should works but i dont have emulator on my pc to check if it really works, i only simulate within the website and my personal iphone throuph expo app

```
$ npm install
$ expo start
```
